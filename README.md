# Simulated Hack App (Prank)

**What this is:**  
A harmless visual simulation — looks like a 'hacker' app with green terminal text that types lines one after another.  
**Important:** This is a prank/simulation only. NO real systems are accessed or compromised.

## Files
- `index.html` — the prank web app. Open in a browser or host via GitHub Pages.

## Quick publish to GitHub Pages (web UI)
1. Go to https://github.com and sign in.
2. Create a new repository (e.g. `prank-app`).
3. Upload `index.html` to the repository root (use "Add file" → "Upload files") and commit.
4. Go to **Settings → Pages** (or **Settings → Code and automation → Pages**).
5. Under **Build and deployment**, choose branch `main` and folder `/ (root)`, then Save.
6. The site will be published at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` (may take a minute).

## Quick publish using git (if you prefer terminal)
```bash
git init
git add index.html
git commit -m "add prank index"
git branch -M main
# replace <your-username> and <repo-name>:
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
git push -u origin main
```
Then enable GitHub Pages from the repository Settings as described above.

## Notes & Etiquette
- Use this only for friendly, consensual pranks. Do NOT use it to deceive, intimidate, or extort someone.
- Make sure the recipient understands it's a joke — keep the "SIMULATION / PRANK" badge visible.

Enjoy! 🎭
